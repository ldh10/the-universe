I am holding a cup of luke-warm coffee. Snow was on the ground. The cup is only a quarter full. I care about the environment, and the ones working for it. Should I throw away the whole thing, with the liquid inside? I start chugging the coffee into my stomach. Wait. Maybe I care about my body too. I slipped. A little bit of coffee went dripping on my coat. Coffee stain to a dark coat was just a nice little hint of pleasent scent. Just like a heartbreak is to my beautiful heart.

You’re the only friend I need.

The Universe is always speaking to us. It's our job to listen.

You could absolutely break my heart. That's how we know that we're in love.

The truth is, you never leave. 

What’s so big and important in this huge, huge universe that makes us so different?

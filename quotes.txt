I am holding a cup of luke-warm coffee. Snow was on the ground. The cup is only a quarter full. I care about the environment, and the ones working for it. Should I throw away the whole thing, with the liquid inside? I start chugging the coffee into my stomach. Wait. Maybe I care about my body too. I slipped. A little bit of coffee went dripping on my coat. Coffee stain to a dark coat was just a nice little hint of pleasent scent. Just like a heartbreak is to my beautiful heart.

you’re the only friend I need, <br> coffee heart beat through which I breathe. <br> look through the mirror while I sing,<br>chin drips of toothpaste, tickly teeth. <br>bang your head, this house music hits hard.<br>lick a page, though not a single word.<br>let the light in through the little cracks.<br>rough as a spike collar on my neck.<br>time fades as a personal identity,<br>beauty expires as one’s vanity,<br>but maybe a bird I’d rather be,<br>whether to be or to have been.<br>you’re the only rush I need,<br>close my eyes and roll it around.<br>icy mango bittery fresh, dang, gotta go brush my teeth. (again)

The Universe is always speaking to us. It's our job to listen.
In the midst of chaos, find your stillness.
Your energy introduces you before you even speak.

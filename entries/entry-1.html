            If at the core of your existence is the unavailability of generalization, why should i ever know anything
            about you?
            How could i ever know anything about you? It clearer than ever to me that making a statement of you (how you
            work, how you grant people their experiences and love) requires a bold step of exclusion of exceptions and
            removal of memories, then what is the whole point? Why should i be doing this in the sake of disregarding
            the existence of myself (which is in fact equivalent to your existence) in a different point of time-space?"
